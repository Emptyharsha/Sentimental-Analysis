### 1. **Project Overview:**
This project focuses on developing a **Sentiment Analysis** model to classify customer restaurant reviews into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments. The goal is to leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze customer feedback, helping restaurants improve services and understand customer satisfaction.

### 2. **Problem Statement:**
With the rapid growth of online reviews, restaurants rely heavily on customer feedback for improving services and attracting new customers. Analyzing these reviews provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction, but manual analysis is time-consuming. A sentiment analysis model automates this process, classifying the reviews into useful categories for actionable insights.

### 3. **Proposed Solution:**
A machine learning model will be developed to classify customer feedback using **NLP** techniques. The model will process review texts and categorize them into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments. It uses **Python** libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Sklearn**, **nltk**, and **Matplotlib** for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### 4. **System Development Approach:**
- **Data Collection**: Data is scraped from online review platforms (e.g., Google Maps, Zomato).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves lowercasing, removing punctuation, and eliminating stop words.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Various algorithms like **Naive Bayes**, **SVM**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Neural Networks** are used to classify reviews.
- **Deployment**: The trained model can be deployed using web applications or APIs to predict new review sentiments.

### 5. **System Requirements:**
- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: Data manipulation
  - NumPy: Numerical computation
  - Sklearn: Machine Learning algorithms
  - nltk: Natural Language Processing
  - Matplotlib: Data visualization

### 6. **Model Development:**
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Naive Bayes**: Efficient and simple text classifier.
  - **SVM**: Effective in handling high-dimensional data.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Suitable for binary classification (positive/negative sentiment).
  - **Neural Networks**: Advanced deep learning models like **RNNs** and **LSTMs** for complex text relationships.
- **Training and Testing**: Data is split into training and test sets. The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
- **Result**: The model achieved an **accuracy of 85%**. Performance metrics were visualized using tools like the confusion matrix and **ROC curve**.

### 7. **Conclusion**:
The sentiment analysis model provides actionable insights for restaurant management, helping them understand customer preferences and improve services. By analyzing trends over time, restaurants can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. This project highlights the potential of sentiment analysis in the food industry and lays the groundwork for future development.

### 8. **Future Scope**:
- **Advanced NLP**: Explore advanced techniques to handle complex language structures such as sarcasm and slang.
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Combine data from various sources (e.g., social media, sales) to get a holistic view of customer sentiment and restaurant performance.
